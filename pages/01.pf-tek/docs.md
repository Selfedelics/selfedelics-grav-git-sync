This section was taken from [https://web.archive.org/web/20070717005044/http://www.fanaticus.com/pftek.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20070717005044/http://www.fanaticus.com/pftek.htm) .  This seems to be the last snapshot available in the Internet Archives.  I have only made changes where needed to adopt it to markdown language which really resulted in just normalization of title and header capitalization and formating of lists.  I have added markdown "notes" when PF has issued "warnings" or "important" tips as it is convinient to do so for readability.  My goal was readability first, then presevation of the content a very close second. I have removed no content other than what I deemed redundant or confusing, which really only resulted in a couple of deletions of akward parenthisized suggestions as to where to find materials, such as "(pet stores or hardware stores)".  The materials in questions are all available at any hardware store and these days obtainable directly from Mushroom cultivation websites, and even Amazon.com.  Back in the day the pet stores was probably a good option, too. I find these tips just made the text harder to read, and ulitimately unneeded with todays internet search and sourcing capabilities. By removing them and just reformating a few other things I belive I have made the text more readable, and preserved all the actionable knowledge.  Again, I made no changes to content, no gramarical, spelling or structual changes other than those mentioned above. This _is_ essentially the **PF Tek** as it was captured last change in July 17th, 2007 adopted to markdown formatting. By capturing this in markdown I hope to make the origional PF Tek portable and accesible.
