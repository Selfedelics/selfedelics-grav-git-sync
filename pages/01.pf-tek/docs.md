This _is_ the original **PF Tek**,  [http://www.fanaticus.com/](http://www.fanaticus.com/),  adopted to markdown language formatting. By capturing this in markdown I  hope to make the original PF Tek portable and accessible.  For instance, markdown can easily be converted to other formats, like PDF,  ePub or Wiki markups and in addition is very readable as-is. Probably of greater usefulness is when the markdown rendered back to HTML and displayed in a modern CMSs with well-designed presentations (themes). The PF Tek goes from being a really ugly HTML 1.0 site that is very hard to read on a mobile device, to one that reads just as well as any other page or post you would publish. We don't change any of the content, we just make it easier to read!

Snap shots of the origional site can also be found in the Internet Archives [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190719194443/http://www.fanaticus.com/).
