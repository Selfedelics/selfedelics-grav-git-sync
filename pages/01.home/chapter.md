## Welcome to Selfedelics.com

This site is about "selfedelics" and how to do it. #selfedelics

I want to share with you how you can DIY grow psilocybin mushrooms and mescaline active San Pedro cacti in the comfort of your own home. It's not very hard if you have just a little patience, and it's a lot of fun! I have coined the activity of growing and harvesting a psychedelic garden for personal use as selfedelics, as in, do it your self psychedelics.

Not that DIY psychedelics are anything new, they most certainly aren't. Still, I do believe the activity of growing these plants for personal use at home is once again picking up popularity and creeping its way into the "mainstream" and is no longer just relegated to hippies and college kids. We need a general term for this type of "gardening" as surely the list of things to grow DIY at home will widen as more and more people get turned on to the practice. I think "Selfedelics" sounds good!
